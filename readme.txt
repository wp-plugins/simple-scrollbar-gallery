simple scrollbar gallery for WordPress is an image gallery as a WordPress plugin.

The plugin uses the shortcode [gallery] and supports all the standard gallery attributes.

The plugin uses jQuery, and if your site doesn't already use jQuery, it'll add the script for you. 

== Description ==

Inspired by many other scripts.

1. Unpack the plugin, put it in your "plugins" folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`).
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins section.
